## The Defect Analysis Package (DefAP)

DefAP is a program developed to facilitate the exploration of a material's defect chemistry. A large number of features are provided and rapid exploration is supported through the use of autoplotting with carefully considered automatic data labelling and simplification options enabling production of publication quality plots. 

## Installation

DefAP is a Python (Python 3.6.9 tested) code that runs in a command-line interface using Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS) or MacOS (tested on ...). The following modules are required. 
- numpy
- scipy

A gnuplot installation is also required (tested with gnuplot v5.2) as well as GV (tested with gv 3.7.4) if using a Linux system and want to automatically view plots.  

## Usage

To operate DefAP, please consult the operating manual included in the software.

A new publication detailing the full methods of DefAP will be available soon.
